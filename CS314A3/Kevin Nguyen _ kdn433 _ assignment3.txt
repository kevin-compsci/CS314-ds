4.) Array comparing elt Big O

Array access = O(1)
Cons elt = O(n)

The array access is a O(1) since arrays a contiguous block of memory that's readily
available for access by the user. However, the elt function for cons has to iterate through
the cons list in order to get to the position of element (usually by rest() function) and
return it.


6.) Shape of curve for interpolation

The shape of the curve is similiar to a sine wave graph.
