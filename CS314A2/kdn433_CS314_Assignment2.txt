2.) Peanoplus

The Big O of Peanoplus; O(n)

The invariant property exists for x and y parameters. They would eventually sum to a 
constant to where it doesn't change with any of the iterations.


3.) Peanotimes

Big O of Peanotimes; O(n)


8.) Relationship between Binomial Coefficients and n choose k

The Binomial Coefficients and n choose k are identical and equal based on the "n" value.
The value n represents the rows of the Pascal Triangle with n = 0 at the top of the triangle.
The bottom of the Pascal Triangle would have n = z, z being any value of positive integers. 
K gives the position from left to right within the rows.
