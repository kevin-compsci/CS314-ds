1.) Big O comparison destructive merge and sort.

Big O of destructive merge: O(nlog(n))
Sort method: O(nlog(n))


2.) How much garbage is produced by sort function?

The amound of garbage is mostly equivalent to the Big(O), nlog(n). The amount of
space and time required is parallel to each initializations. As a result, the amount gained
is the amount that is garbage collected. In this case, we used a quicksort to make
new sublists, sorted them, and merge them (3 instances for garbage).
